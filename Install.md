# qFADD.py Installation Instructions

This document details the steps required to install the qFADD.py program.
This procedure will install both the command-line and GUI versions of the programs.

1. Install the open-source Anaconda (v3) distribution, in accordance to your computing environment
and Anaconda's installation instructions.

2. Use `conda` to install the necessary packages for running qFADD-related programs:
    
    a. Since many software packages rely on specific versions of different python libraries,
    you want to make use of the "environments" options of anaconda to manage multiple versions
    of the same libraries.
    
    b. `conda install ffmpeg pyside2`
