# Example Usage of Local qFADD.py Installation

This subdirectory contains all the files you will need to run an example workflow of the qFADD.py pipeline. "run_analyzer.bash" will provide an example for running the image analyzer on an example acquisition (example_imagestack.nd2 and example_ROI.tif). example_imagestack.nd2 was uploaded as a .zip archive to satisfy GitHub's maximum file size requirements, and therefore must be extracted prior to running the example workflow. "run_qFADD.bash" will provide an example for running the Q-FADD routine. Precalculated results from both files can be found in the "precalculated_results" subdirectory.
